INTROï¼š
To play the game, the user first enters a "seed" value, which is an integer. This seed value initializes a pseudo-random number generator. 
Using the pseudo-random number generator, a solution code sequence of four numbers from 1 to 8 is chosen at "random." This solution is kept hidden from the player.
The player then has 12 guesses to get the sequence of four numbers correct. Guesses are typed into the terminal. 
After each guess, the player is given feedback on the number of perfect matches and misplaced matches, which is printed to the screen.
The values of the guess that appear in the same place in the solution code are called perfect matches. 
The number of values that appear somewhere in the solution code but in a different place in the solution code are called misplaced matches. 
If the player manages to guess the correct sequence in twelve or fewer guesses, they win the game. Otherwise, they lose.
Three functions:
set_seed -- This function sets the seed value for pseudorandom
start_game -- This function is called by main.c after set_seed but before the user makes guesses.
make_guess -- This function is called by main.c after the user types in a guess.

/*
 * set_seed -- This function sets the seed value for pseudorandom

 * This function should use the function sscanf to find the integer seed value from the 
 * string seed_str, then initialize the random number generator by calling srand with the integer
 * seed value. To be valid, exactly one integer must be entered by the user, anything else is invalid. 
 * INPUTS: seed_str -- a string (array of characters) entered by the user, containing the random seed
 * OUTPUTS: none
 * RETURN VALUE: 0 if the given string is invalid (string contains anything
 *               other than a single integer), or 1 if string is valid (contains one integer)
 * SIDE EFFECTS: initializes pseudo-random number generation using the function srand. Prints "set_seed: invalid seed\n"
